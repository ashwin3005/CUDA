# Day 10

- Today I have learnt about PTX.
    - PTX is an intermediate representation used in the CUDA toolkit.

- Went into a rabbit-hole of LLVM, Graphics APIs etc..

### Resources
- [LLVM Project](https://llvm.org/)
- [How LLVM & Clang work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IR_L1xf4PrU)
- [PTX Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/)
- [Optimizing Matmul](https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM)

Revisited tiled matrix multiplication to make my understanding stronger.
