## Softmax
Today I have implemented a simple version of Softmax function.
Later spent time on optimizing it. i.e., Online Softmax.

## Euler's number

$$e = 2.71828...$$

- Like the constant Ï€, e is irrational, meaning that it cannot be represented as a ratio of integers

- It is the sum of the infinite series,

$$e = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} = 1 + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1 \cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3} + \cdots $$

- e is quite special in calculus because,
One of the most notable properties of $ e $ is that the derivative of $e^x$ is simply $e^x$. This means that the function $e^x$ is its own derivative, which is a rare and elegant property in mathematics. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$\frac{d}{dx} e^{x} = e^{x}$$
